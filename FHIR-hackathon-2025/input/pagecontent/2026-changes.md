### Learning from 2025

The main learning point from 2025 is that all organizers are motivated to continue working like this and organize another hackathon in 2026.

#### Good

* Great involvement from all the organizers!
* The tracks OKT, PMD and authoring tracks worked great!
* Good size group of participants
* Promotion work from all organizers
* Funding worked perfectly
* Snacks during the day was good
* EHiN photos was great and can be used for promotion
* Three to four tracks is ideal

#### OK

* EHiN as arena, did it give us anything?
* Food was OK
* Terminology did not draw much attention
* The room got noisy and maybe a bit to busy?

#### Bad

* Need more clinicians for some of the discussions (esp. OKT)
* Hellerudsletta as venue is not a good solution
* Language english or norwegian? Should choose norwegian as language
* Terminology track was not successful (few attendees and unfortunately the track lead got ill on the day)
* Two pre-meetings was not necessary and did not help an attendee preparedness(?)
* A number of participants did not attend pre-meetings and was not prepared for the hackathon
* Some confusion about start time as EHIN pre conference had an official start up time after the actual Hackathon start up time

### Proposed changes

Make the FHIR hackathon the perfect arena for diect co-development of applications and API's.

Changes for 2026:  

* Get more clinicians to participate in the hackathon to facilitate co-developments of API's and software solutions by developers and end users.  
  * Refine user needs by providing user feedback based on testing.  
  * Describe wanted changes based on refined user needs.  
* Make actual end user applications and prototypes and implement quick changes to the api and end-user applications.
* Arrange the hackathon as separate sessions (like ICD-11 hackathon)
  * intro to FHIR and tracks first half of the day
  * hacking for the rest of the day.  
* Arrange one pre-meeting instead of two.
* Decide on language (Norwegian)

### Method

Method for user involvement in software development. The software user, usually clinicians, work with developers and architects to develop software that directly adresses the users concerns and needs.

* **User needs** Establish and prioritize user needs and concerns to work with in this iteration.  
* **Design** Design software products that addresses the prioritized user needs.  
* **Development** Develop prototypes and software products.  
* **Testing** Testing the software products/prototypes, both technical and by the users.  
* **Discusion and evaluation** Discuss the test results and evaluate how the product adresses the user needs.  
* **Iteration feedback** Add and update user needs and concerns discovered in the iteration.  

### Value proposal (use-case)

Why should clinicians care and participate?
