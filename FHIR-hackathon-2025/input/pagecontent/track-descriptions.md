### Introduction to tracks

This page contains a quick writeup of the use cases in the different tracks of the 2025 Norwegian FHIR Hackathon.
**NOTE! The track descriptions are currently under active development and changes will occur without further notice.**

### Track: Pasientens måledata (PMD) FHIR API

Excercise on using the Pasientens måledata API to exchange data to/from the PMD API.

#### Step 1: Introduction to Pasientens måledata (PMD) FHIR API.
About the API and design choices.

Based on your product/solution/needs do Step 2 and/or Step 3.

#### Step 2: Use documentation from NHN developer portal to retrieve data.
Help available if needed.

#### Step 3: Use documentation from NHN developer portal to write data.
Help available if needed.

#### Step 4: Find someone who did the opposite of you in step 2 and 3, and test that data from one can be read by the other.
If you´ve done both 2 and 3, try testing both against other participants.

#### Step 5: If you have a GUI - try showing data from multiple other vendors.

### Track: Make a FHIR version of the OKT API

This is an exercise in translating an existing API, both data structures and interactions, to FHIR resources and the FHIR REST API. It should give participants practical, hands-on experience in designing and implementing FHIR-enabled services.

We will look at the proprietary [OKT API](https://utviklerportal.nhn.no/informasjonstjenester/felles-journalloeft/okt-prototype/okt-api) from NHN, and discuss which FHIR resources and REST interactions we can translate the API into.

Several resources might fit the purpose, including `EpisodeOfCare`, `CarePlan`, and `ServiceRequest`. We will discuss the resource descriptions and the data fields to see which one is the best match. Other projects, e.g. the use of [`EpisodeOfCare` in Velferdsteknologisk knutepunkt (VKP)](https://simplifier.net/guide/velferdsteknologiskknutepunktvkp-r4/episodeofcare?version=current) will also be considered.

The more technically inclined may also demonstrate the conversion from the proprietary API to FHIR, either in code or in FHIR, using `StructureMap` resources. Examples of both will be provided among the hackathon resources.

#### Preparations

To be able to get started with the discussion of possible solutions quicker at the hackathon, we recommend that track participants familiarize themselves with

* The documentation of the current [OKT API](https://utviklerportal.nhn.no/informasjonstjenester/felles-journalloeft/okt-prototype/okt-api)
* The draft implementation guide for the OKT FHIR API (link will be published before the hackathon)

#### Relation to other tracks

* FHIR IG building and authoring: The recommendations will be added to a FHIR implementation guide. This can be a use case for the IG authoring track.
* Nordic tx FHIR server API: The profiles will likely contain some coded data. Making these codes available for the IG authoring process is a use case for the terminology server track.

### Track: Nordic tx FHIR server API

Established in cooperation by the nordic HL7 affiliates (HL7 Sweden, HL7 Denmark, HL7 Finland and HL7 Norway) to establish a common nordic terminology server to host codesystems and valuesets for use with HL7 FHIR in standardization efforts.

> DISCLAIMER: The nordic terminology server is not intended for use in a production environment. A separate terminology server should be set up by your organization for production use in your IT-infrastructure.

#### Use cases

#### IG building
The main use case for the Nordic terminology server is to make building FHIR IGs using terminology defined in the Nordic countries easier. The common Nordic terminology server should host and maintain codesystems and valuesets that are used in Nordic FHIR IG's and FHIR implementations. The server should be registered to tx.fhir.org to support validation in the FHIR build process. There are a number of valuesets and codesystems that are used in the Nordics:

* National editions of SNOMED CT
* National ValueSets defined and maintained by the affiliates
  * These valuesets are typically used in core and base profiles.
  * Examples are valuesets used in Norwegian vitalsign profiles.
* National CodeSystems used in core and base profiles

#### Translation

Provide national displays for HL7 code system concepts by hosting "language packs" on tx-nordics.

#### Building IGs

HL7 Sweden is currently hosting a terminology server at https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir for use in the Nordics, and IGs can be built using this server with:

```sh
./_genonce.sh -tx https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir/r4
```

#### Terminology APIs
In addition to the FHIR terminology server API for authoring, we will also have an educational track on using the terminology APIs for searching and retrieving codes, valuesets and concepts from the terminology server. As mentioned previously, this is not intended for production use, and will only serve an educational purpose in this hackathon.

Sample APIs that can be used against the nordic terminology server:

```
# expand a valueset
GET https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir/r4/ValueSet/2d9364e2-9e55-4872-969a-b8e1b0655c16/$expand

# expand a valueset with displays in Norwegian
GET https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir/r4/ValueSet/common-conditions-vs/$expand?displayLanguage=no

# expand a valueset with displays in English
GET https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir/r4/ValueSet/common-conditions-vs/$expand?displayLanguage=en

# look up all properties of a SNOMED code
GET https://tx-nordics.fhir.org/fhir/r4/CodeSystem/$lookup?system=http://snomed.info/sct&code=263495000&_format=json
```

### Track: FHIR IG authoring and building

FHIR IG authoring for documenting a FHIR RestfulAPI can seem like a big challenge to new FHIR developers. In this track we introduce the participants to FHIR IG authoring, building and how to publish a draft on Github. The participation in this track can be combined with participation in PMD/OKT API development tracks, to document results from work in those tracks.

#### Prerequisites and preparations

There is no need for prior knowledge on FHIR or IG building before participation. You can build an IG entirely on Github but it will be faster if you have preinstalled the necessary tools on you own computer. Basic knowlege of HL7 FHIR standard is helpful, also a thought about a use-case you want to work with before the workshop (both PMD and OKT are valid use-cases for authoring and building an IG).

##### Preparations

The presentations from the pre-meetings contain information about the FHIR IG authoring track included links to tools, introductory guides and specifications that are usefull to prepare for the Hackathon.

Presentation: [FHIR Hackathon pre meeting 2 and IG authoring](FHIR-Hackathon-2025-premeeting-2.pdf)  

#### Learning goals

* Basic understanding of the role of FHIR profiling
* Know the necessary tools for building FHIR IG's

  * Simplifier Github integration
* Learn how to write FHIR documentation using FSH or Forge
* Learn how to use the tools for FHIR IG authoring
* Learn how to present a draft IG using Github.io or Simplifier.net
