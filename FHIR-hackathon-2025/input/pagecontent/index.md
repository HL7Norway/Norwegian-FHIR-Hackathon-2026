### Pre-meetings

We will arrange two pre meetings before the hackathon. The pre meetings will be arranged one and two weeks before the actual hackathon (on october 27th and november 3rd 1000-1100). The track leads will introduce the different tracks and there will be time for questions and discussions about how to prepare for the actual hackathon. Both pre-meetings will be digital only on Teams, and you will receive an invite for the pre meeting via e-mail (you can also download an ical from the [meeting pages](https://hl7norway.github.io/FHIR-hackathon-2025/currentbuild/pre-agenda.html)).

### Why should you attend?

The main goals of the Norwegian FHIR Hackathon is to build FHIR competence in the Norwegian e-health community by implementing and testing actual FHIR RESTful API's and software. The Norwegian FHIR Hackathon is a typical learning-by-doing event where you can expect to build, write and test things yourself.
