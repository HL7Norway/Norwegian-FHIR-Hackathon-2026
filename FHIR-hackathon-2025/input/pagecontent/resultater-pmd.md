### PMD track summary

12 participants

All participants completed the test-cases described in the track intro. This was a good test of the API implementation and the API documentation. NHN got a good idea of how the profiles worked and what kind of data was possible to transmit using the input-API. NHN also got a lot of inpu regarding how to build a good FHIR API, and how developers expect to use FHIR API's.  

#### Further work  

Several ideas for development of the PMD-API where discussed

* How to document measurment context and provenance
* What does a single measurement result mean
* How to identify the series of measurments that are connected  
* How to document and read the quality of the data
* Who is responsible for the quality of the data

#### Background

The developer portal for PMD is at https://utviklerportal.nhn.no/informasjonstjenester/pasientens-maaledata.

#### Demo App

Demo app for observation post/get and some utilities:

[Demo app](https://fhir-hackathon-pmd.vercel.app/)

#### Identified issues

##### Error messages are not that descriptive

It would be very nice for developers, but not the biggest priority.

##### Big bundles do not go through

The platform does not accept a Bundle of 10 Mb. The use case is when you onboard a new patient and
want to record a lot of historical data.

This is probably a load balancer configuration issue.

We don’t know what file size is accepted. It would be nice to have this in documentation.

##### Conditional Create is not supported

Yet.

It will be essential, when data starts to stream in from multiple sources. It is also convenient
for a single source of data, as it greatly simplifies deduplication.

##### Results of a Bundle are not returned directly

It’s not clear how the Bundle is processed.

#### Open Questions

##### How to record Provenance?

It is important to capture the source of the data. How should this be recorded and communicated?

A simple solution is to use the
[`Observation.meta.source`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource-definitions.html#Meta.source)
element.

The FHIR standard also has the Provenance resource type that should probably be used, as it
enables the entire flow of data to be recorded, and accommodates more data.

Some implementations use the Provenance resource as a separate entity. It may be difficult to
record the Provenance resource together with the Observation, especially when recording a lot of
data in Bundles using conditional create.

A simple implementation adopted in some early implementations is to contain the Provenance in the
Observation. This is not a good fit for batch processing, and makes searching by provenance hard -
but it is easy to implement.

In some cases, like dosing medication, context around a measurement is very important. For a
primary clinician approximate weight might be enough, for cancer treatment the weight is very
sensitive.

#### Notable Results

It is good that the profile is permissive

Sensotrend was able to post data used in other environments, with minor changes. The biggest change
was the use of identifiers instead of id’s in `.subject` and `.performer references`.
